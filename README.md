<b> FriendsConnect </b>

This project allows a user to easily schedule events with contacts on their phone, namely through Yelp and E-Mail integration. The project utilizes a standard design pattern for Android Applications: Model-View-Presenter (MVP). 

<b> Getting the Application </b>

To get a copy of the application, you will need Android Studio Version 2.0 (or higher). This project was developed in 2.1. Clone the repository in a directory, open up Android Studio, and under File, click "Import Existing Project". Browse your directories until you reach the cloned repository, and click on "app" to load it up.

<b> Running the Application </b>

To run the application, first give Android Studio a few minutes to allow Gradle to sync necessary libraries and process dependencies. Then, simply click the green "Play" button near the top of the browser. If you have an Android device plugged in to your computer, you can download it onto your device. Otherwise, Android Studio will walk you through creating an emulator which you can then use to run the application.

Eventually, the application will be available on the Google Play Store.
