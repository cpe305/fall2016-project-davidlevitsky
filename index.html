<a id="friendsconnect" class="anchor" href="#friendsconnect" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FriendsConnect</h3>

<p>This project was developed by David Levitsky at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, as part of CPE 305 - Individual Software Design and Development.</p>

<h3>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>Connecting with others has become a big focus in today's fast-paced day and age. While there are many different applications to help facilitate interactions between two different users, they all operate separately and on their own premise. This application strives to integrate pre-existing services using developer API's to allow users to schedule events with their friends in a simpler and quicker manner than the status quo. After all, when our smartphones have more capabilities than the computers that landed us on the Moon, shouldn't inviting a friend out be a breeze?</p>

<p>Some key features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calendar view</li>
<li>Yelp Search Integration</li>
<li>E-Mail Notification</li>
<li>Dynamic Upcoming Schedule Viewer</li>
<li>History of Past Events</li>
<li>Feedback Mechanism for Previous Events</li>
<li>Persistence of Data through Realm Database</li>
</ul>

<a id="using-yelp" class="anchor" href="#using-yelp" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using Yelp</h3>

<p>If you're not sure about a good place to venture with a friend, whether it be for a dinner, museum, or a run, FriendsConnect provides simple access to Yelp without forcing you to open up a separate application. Simply type in a search term, like "dinner", and your preferred location, such as "San Francisco", and choose from generated results!</p>

<p><b> High-Level Architecture <b></b></b></p>

<p>Android operates on a Model-View-Presenter architecture. This architecture is highly effective because screens could change at any time, based on a button press or some user input.</p>

<ul>
<li>View is a layer that displays data and reacts to user actions. On Android, this could be an Activity, a Fragment, an android.view.View or a Dialog.</li>
<li>Model is a data access layer such as database API or remote server API.</li>
<li>Presenter is a layer that provides View with data from Model. Presenter also handles background tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see a high-level overview below. Note that the Presenter is the only method of communication between the View and the Model, and that the two should never be able to communicate directly.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-davidlevitsky/blob/master/MVPGeneral.png?raw=true" alt=""></p>

<p><b> Design Architecture <b></b></b></p>

<p>Here you can see the design structure of the project, complete with class diagrams, activities, and XML files. The MVP structure was slightly modified to add a persistence layer, which is a Realm database used to store created events. </p>

<p>The Model layer describes the core data structures and logic. The EventsList is the main container of information, since it holds all past and future Events that a user has scheduled. ContactsList is a Singleton representation of the user's contacts pulled from their phone after permission is granted. YelpResults are used to store information created by the YelpAPI.</p>

<p>The Presenter layer outlines the different screens that the user will see, specifically the various Activities. Each Activity serves its own purpose. By using Intents, the Activities are able to communicate with each other and create data flow.</p>

<p>The View layer lists the XML files used for visual representation of the aforementioned Activities.</p>

<a id="design-patterns" class="anchor" href="#design-patterns" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Patterns</h3>

<p>The Singleton pattern was used twice in this project - one to create an instance of EventsList, which is a tangible Java representation of information stored in a Realm database, while the other is an instance of ContactsList, which is responsible for storing a user's contacts.</p>
