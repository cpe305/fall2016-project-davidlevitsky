<a id="friendsconnect" class="anchor" href="#friendsconnect" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FriendsConnect</h3>

<p>This project was developed by David Levitsky at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, as part of CPE 305 - Individual Software Design and Development.</p>

<h3>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>Connecting with others has become a big focus in today's fast-paced day and age. While there are many different applications to help facilitate interactions between two different users, they all operate separately and on their own premise. This application strives to integrate pre-existing services using developer API's to allow users to schedule events with their friends in a simpler and quicker manner than the status quo. After all, when our smartphones have more capabilities than the computers that landed us on the Moon, shouldn't inviting a friend out be a breeze?</p>

<p>Some key features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calendar view</li>
<li>Yelp Search Integration</li>
<li>E-Mail Notification</li>
<li>Dynamic Upcoming Schedule Viewer</li>
<li>History of Past Events</li>
<li>Feedback Mechanism for Previous Events</li>
<li>Persistence of Data through Realm Database</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're not sure about a good place to venture with a friend, whether it be for a dinner, museum, or a run, FriendsConnect provides simple access to Yelp without forcing you to open up a separate application. Simply type in a search term, like "dinner", and your preferred location, such as "San Francisco", and choose from generated results!</p>

<p><b> High-Level Architecture <b></b></b></p>

<p>Android operates on a Model-View-Presenter architecture. This architecture is highly effective because screens could change at any time, based on a button press or some user input.</p>

<ul>
<li>View is a layer that displays data and reacts to user actions. On Android, this could be an Activity, a Fragment, an android.view.View or a Dialog.</li>
<li>Model is a data access layer such as database API or remote server API.</li>
<li>Presenter is a layer that provides View with data from Model. Presenter also handles background tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see a high-level overview below. Note that the Presenter is the only method of communication between the View and the Model, and that the two should never be able to communicate directly.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-davidlevitsky/blob/master/MVPGeneral.png?raw=true" alt=""></p>

<p><b> Design Architecture <b></b></b></p>

<p>Here you can see the design structure of the project, complete with class diagrams, activities, and XML files. The MVP structure was slightly modified to add a persistence layer, which is a Realm database used to store created events. </p>

<p>The Model layer describes the core data structures and logic. The EventsList is the main container of information, since it holds all past and future Events that a user has scheduled. ContactsList is a Singleton representation of the user's contacts pulled from their phone after permission is granted. YelpResults are used to store information created by the YelpAPI.</p>

<p>The Presenter layer outlines the different screens that the user will see, specifically the various Activities. Each Activity serves its own purpose. By using Intents, the Activities are able to communicate with each other and create data flow.</p>

<p>The View layer lists the XML files used for visual representation of the aforementioned Activities.</p>

<h3>
<a id="design-patterns" class="anchor" href="#design-patterns" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Patterns</h3>

<p>The Singleton pattern was used twice in this project - one to create an instance of EventsList, which is a tangible Java representation of information stored in a Realm database, while the other is an instance of ContactsList, which is responsible for storing a user's contacts. The benefits of using a Singleton pattern was to improve the organization and performance of the application. Re-loading the user's contacts consistently would become an expensive operation, so doing it once and storing the result in a Singleton class prevents redundancy. For the EventsList class, allowing multiple instances of a database representation could cause serious bugs if different threads were operating on the database simultaneously.</p>

<p><b> Architecture <b></b></b></p>

<p>Although the initial architecture diagrams developed prior to writing the application were decently structured, I ended up needing a lot more classes than I originally planned. While writing the code, I focused too much on implementation and did not revisit the architectural design as much as I should have. Therefore, although the MVP structure still works fine, the class diagram in the model section could have been much cleaner and more modular. I would propose this kind of structure for the model if I were to rewrite my application:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-davidlevitsky/blob/master/FutureClassDiagram.png?raw=true" alt=""></p>

<p><b> Design Patterns <b></b></b></p>

<p>Using the Singleton design pattern helped greatly to organize pieces of data that remained fairly constant. However, my communication between the Realm Database and the EventsList Singleton could have been improved by using an Observer pattern. As proposed in the class diagram above, I would have added an EventListener to modify the Realm Database whenever an Event was added/deleted from the EventsList instance.</p>

<p><b> Future Features <b></b></b></p>

<p>The application could benefit greatly from integrating the Google Maps API so a user can immediately look up directions to an event directly from the application. The usage of the Yelp API could be flushed out to take into consideration additional factors such as price. Adding an option to allow notes to be attached to an invitation would be helpful. As always, the User Interface could be more appealing to the eye.</p>

<p><b> Concluding Thoughts <b></b></b></p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the process of designing a system, implementing it, and then analyzing the final product. I was able to use several design patterns to establish a sustainable and structurally sound architecture, which benefitted the readability and performance of the application. I really enjoyed working with the Yelp API, as it was very easy to use and provided great data. I learned from my mistake of focusing only on implementation rather than revisiting the architectural design once I needed additional data models, and I look forward to improving my software design skills with future projects.</p>
