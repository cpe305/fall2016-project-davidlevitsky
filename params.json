  "body": "\r\n### FriendsConnect\r\nThis project was developed by David Levitsky at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, as part of CPE 305 - individual software design and development.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nConnecting with others has become a big focus in today's fast-paced day and age. While there are many different applications to help facilitate interactions between two different users, they all operate separately and on their own premise. This application strives to integrate pre-existing services using developer API's to allow users to schedule events with their friends in a simpler and quicker manner than the status quo. After all, when our smartphones have more capabilities than the computers that landed us on the Moon, shouldn't inviting a friend out be a breeze?\r\n\r\nSome key features:\r\n* Calendar view\r\n* Yelp Search Integration\r\n* E-Mail Notification\r\n* Dynamic Upcoming Schedule Viewer\r\n* History of Past Events\r\n* Feedback Mechanism for Previous Events\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-davidlevitsky/blob/master/MVPOverview.png?raw=true)\r\n",
